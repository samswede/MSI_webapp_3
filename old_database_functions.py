    This function reads nodes and edges from CSV files and loads them into a Neo4j database. 
    It uses the MERGE command to ensure that only unique nodes are created.
    
    Notes:

        Ensure that nodes.csv and edges.csv are located in the import directory of your Neo4j instance. This is typically $NEO4J_HOME/import for a local installation.

        Keep in mind that Neo4jâ€™s LOAD CSV expects URLs relative to the $NEO4J_HOME/import directory. Files should be put in this directory to be found.

        The LOAD CSV clause reads from CSV files, while MERGE ensures that only one node is created for each unique value.

        The MATCH clause is used to find the nodes that the edge should connect, and the final MERGE clause creates the relationship.

        Finally, keep in mind that these operations may take a while if you are working with large datasets.

        This function assumes that your CSV files have the headers 'node', 'type', 'source', 'target', and 'weight'. Make sure to adjust the code if your CSV files use different header names.
